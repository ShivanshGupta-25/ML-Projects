# 🚀 Machine Learning

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Repository**! 🌟  
This repo is a personal collection of my **hands-on ML projects**, where I’m learning and sharing everything from **the basics to real-world applications**.  
Each project here is designed to be **simple, understandable, and practical** — perfect for anyone exploring ML from the ground up.

## 🧠 About This Repository

This repository showcases my **progressive learning path** in Machine Learning.  
Every project is implemented in a **single Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** for clarity and ease of understanding.  
All datasets used are included in the **[`Datasets/`](./Datasets)** folder for direct experimentation.

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook 📓  
- **Libraries Used:**  
  - NumPy  
  - Pandas  
  - Matplotlib  
  - Seaborn  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - (and more as projects evolve)

---

## 📘 Learning Focus

Each project focuses on:
- 🔹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- 🔹 Feature Engineering  
- 🔹 Model Selection & Training  
- 🔹 Model Evaluation & Optimization  
- 🔹 Practical Understanding of ML Concepts
